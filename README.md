Water transport through confined nanostructures like nanotubes is a promising area
of research due to its implications for filtration, desalination, and energy applications.
In this paper, we model the behavior of water molecules as they arrange into dimers and
triplets, with triplets forming soliton-like waves that propagate through the nanotube,
leading to ultrafast water transport. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the
influence of lattice spacing, friction, and interaction forces on water flux. We also
present a theoretical model based on soliton dynamics, where triplets form and move
along the nanotube axis, driven by periodic potentials and molecular interactions.
